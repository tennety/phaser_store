## Phaser Store with 2Checkout

Consider the following customer story:

 - I would like to be able to add products to a product catalog on my site, and have the products automatically show up on a shopping page.
 - On the shopping page, I would like for my customers to be able to select the quantity of items to purchase.
 - Then, they can hit a checkout button.
 - I use 2checkout.com as my payment processor. You can see the documentation for 2checkout.com [here](http://developers.2checkout.com).

Write a software solution that addresses the customer's needs.
